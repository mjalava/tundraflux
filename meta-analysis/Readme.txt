df_0

-Study design Figure 1 and Extended Fig. 1 from main text

df_1a

-Effect size calculations of response (ER)
-Links to df_1.csv file with raw flux and environmental data 
-Only the experiments that state ‘Open Access’ in the excel file Authors_Datasets (sheet 2). For experiments stating ‘Available Upon Request’, you need to contact the authors for the -raw flux data.
-Contains code for Fig. 2

df_1b

-Effect size calculations of environmental drivers 
-Links to df_1.csv file with raw flux data data (see above)

df_2a-f

-Meta-analysis (2a) and meta-regression models (2b-f) (ER, N=136)
-Links to df_2.csv file with effect size data and context-dependencies
-Contains code for Figs. 3-4 and Extended Figs 2-3 

df_3

-Meta-regression for experimental warming duration
-Contains code for Fig. 5

df_4a	

-Effect size calculations of autotrophic-heterotrophic respiration partitioning (Ra, Rh, N=9)
-Links to df_3.csv file with raw partitioning data of subset experiments (output file df_4.csv)

df_4b	

-Sub-meta-analysis models (ER, Ra, Rh)
-Links to df_4.csv (input file)

NOTES

•	All additional input files for R-scripts are included in the Zenodo repository
•	ER, Ra, Rh = ecosystem, autotrophic, and heterotrophic respiration
•	N = sample size (number of datasets)
